    "# Task 1 - Getting tweets (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick either two Twitter usernames. These usernames should be \"oppositional\" in nature. I'm leaving the exact meaning of the term \"oppositional\" intentionally vague; the two usernames you pick should be in the same domain (politics, products, pop culture, etc.) but should also be strong contrasts or even rivals. For example:  @Apple vs. @SamsungMobile, @SenMajLdr vs. @SenSchumer, @CocaCola vs. @pepsi, @OfficialKanye vs. @taylorswift13. Basically, if the two handles/hashtags you pick can sensibly fit into the phrase \"A vs. B,\" then they're oppositional.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, use the twitter API to get **the text** of 500 tweets representing the two usernames you pick - specifically, the 500 most recent tweets of the users. Please pick users that tweet primarily in English. This \"English\" requirement is simply so the two instructors can go through the information. This means you'll have a total of 1000 tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do NOT pick any of the examples I gave above above as your two oppositional usernames. Think up an original pair. Note that this task requires you to come up with two \"oppositional\" entities as well as to get those entities most recent tweets. Keep in mind that this is an individual assignment. Any two students who happen to pick the same two oppositional entities may be double checked for cheating, therefore, the more \"original\" your oppositional pair, the better.**"

    "Note 1: When a count vectorizer or TF-IDF vectorizer is instantiated and used to transform your raw text data, it builds a dictionary that indicates which word is assigned to which index. Remember that it produces an $n \\times d$ matrix, where $n$ is the number of samples and $d$ is the number of words. If you want to know the index of a word (that is, which column in $d$ corresponds to that word), you can consult this dictionary. Suppose you named your vectorizer `vec`. To access this dictionary, use `vec.vocabulary_`. If you want to know the index of the word `banana`, access `vec.vocabulary_['banana']`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 2: When you instantiate and train a logistic regression, it saves a set of *coefficients* indicating the \"weight\" of that word in terms of predicting the outcome variable. Suppose you named your classifier `lr`. You can access these coefficients at `lr.coef_[0]`, which is a one-dimensional array. This means that `lr.coef_[0][0]` is the weight of the 0th feature, `lr.coef_[0][1]` is the weight of the 1st feature, and so on. You can also access the intercept at `lr.intercept_`\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, you can *iterate* through `vec.vocabulary_.items()`, and for each word (key) get its index (value) and then find the coefficient weight of that word in the model `lr.coef_[0][index]`\n",
